A simple calculator that computes **simple interest** using the principal amount, annual interest rate, and time (in years).

## Formula
Simple Interest = `p * t * r`

## Inputs
- `p` — principal amount
- `t` — time period (in years)
- `r` — annual rate of interest

## Output
- `simple interest` — the calculated value of `p * t * r`

## Example
If:
- `p = 1000`
- `t = 2`
- `r = 0.05`

Then:
- simple interest = `1000 * 2 * 0.05 = 100`
